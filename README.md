# JustSay

It is a utility application to use the power of speech recognition to make the task of opening a group of files easy by a single speech command.

Motivation:
The motivation for the application was the time I used to waste just opening up certain PDFs before actually beginning to read them. Locating the file also wasted some of my time.

Functionality:
The application provides the user interface to enter, view and delete the commands and the file paths.

Technologies Used:
C# Windows Speech Recognition API, Windows Forms.
